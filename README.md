# Java Projects

A repository for the first set of Java programs I wrote (since 2018) while learning a wide range of techniques required to put together a standard mobile application.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you may run the programs using **IntelliJ IDEA** or an IDE/editor of your choice. 

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8**: At the moment of writing, the source code was written with Java 8. Should you wish to use a higher/up-to-date version, be sure to account for compatibility makeshifts.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
